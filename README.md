## 👋 Hi, I'm Kalidoss

I’m a Senior Solution Architect with 16+ years of experience building enterprise applications using C/C++, .NET, and Python.

I work across Windows-based on-prem systems and hybrid cloud environments, designing scalable, secure, and high-performance solutions. My experience ranges from multi-threaded C++ communication systems to full-stack applications built with ASP.NET Core, REST APIs, and Angular.

### What I Focus On

* Designing scalable and maintainable architectures
* Building robust backend services and Windows applications
* Debugging complex production issues and performance bottlenecks
* Ensuring secure software development through threat modeling and code reviews
* Mentoring teams and driving engineering best practices

### Current Interests

* AI-powered Text-to-SQL systems
* Intelligent dashboards and automation
* Applying machine learning to enterprise systems

I enjoy solving complex technical problems and building systems that are reliable, secure, and built to last.
